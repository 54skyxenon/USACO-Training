# USACO Training Pages

My solutions to every [USACO Training Page](https://train.usaco.org) problem as of 2023. I may use more modern APIs and libraries compared to other solution repositories.

You can copy the template files I use by language, listed alongside this README. Don't forget to change your username and replace all instances of `problemname` with the appropriate one.

## C++

Ensure you have g++ installed, I personally use:
```bash
$ g++ --version
Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.0.40.1)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin22.6.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

To compile:
```bash
$ g++ -std=c++17 problemname.cpp
```

To run with console input/output (useful for testing): 
```bash
$ ./a.out --use-console
...paste input
```

To run with file input/output (default): 
```bash
$ ./a.out
```

## Python

My version of Python:

```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.10.10
```

To run with console input/output (useful for testing): 
```bash
$ python3 problemname.py --use-console
...paste input
```

To run with file input/output (default): 
```bash
$ python3 problemname.py
```
